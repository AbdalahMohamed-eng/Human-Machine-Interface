The Temperature Monitoring and Control System is an embedded application designed for the ATmega2560 microcontroller. It monitors temperature using an LM35 analog temperature sensor, displays real-time temperature and user-defined limits on a 16x2 LCD, and automatically controls a cooling fan and status LEDs based on temperature thresholds.
